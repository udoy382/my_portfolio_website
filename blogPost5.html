      <h1>What is Anonymous (hacker group)</h1>
      <p>
        Anonymous is a loosely-organized international hacker collective that
        has been involved in various political and social movements since its
        inception in 2003. The group is known for its use of "hacktivism," which
        involves hacking into computer systems to make political statements or
        to expose information that they believe is being hidden from the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group is decentralized, meaning that there is no central leadership
        or organization. Members of the group often communicate through online
        forums, chat rooms, and social media platforms using pseudonyms to
        remain anonymous.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anonymous has been involved in a number of high-profile operations,
        including attacks against government and corporate websites, as well as
        protests against social and political issues. The group has targeted a
        wide range of organizations and individuals, including the Church of
        Scientology, the Ku Klux Klan, and various governments around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most notable operations undertaken by Anonymous was Operation
        Payback, which targeted companies that had cut off funding to WikiLeaks
        in 2010. The group launched a series of distributed denial-of-service
        attacks against the targeted companies, causing significant disruption
        to their websites and online operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite its controversial activities, Anonymous has gained a following
        among many who support its stance on issues such as internet freedom,
        government transparency, and social justice. The group has been compared
        to a modern-day Robin Hood, taking from the rich and powerful and giving
        to the people.
      </p>

        However, the group's activities have also been criticized by some for
        their potential to cause harm and disrupt important systems. The group
        has been accused of promoting a vigilante mentality, and some have
        argued that their actions undermine the rule of law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, Anonymous remains a controversial and enigmatic group that has
        continued to evolve and adapt to changing political and social
        landscapes. While its activities may continue to spark debate and
        controversy, it is clear that the group has made a significant impact on
        the world of online activism and political dissent.
